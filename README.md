# Overview

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to collect and update all exercises for
my class (still ongoing).

This is not planned as R package, so no installation needed, just fork
the repository and work within your own github/git/RStudio environment.

## Classic exercises

In this directory, there are six classic exercise sheets filed. Classic
means that the exercises can be solved by pen & paper, you do not need
R. They are quite similar to the assignments in the final exam (also to
be solved by pen & paper, without any additional material or tools). The
topics of the sheets are:

1.  Biological basics
2.  Statistical basics
3.  Statistical concepts in genetics
4.  Populationgenetics & SNP-Arrays
5.  Imputation & genome-wide association analyses
6.  Gene expression analyses

Some of the exercises can be sumbitted and will be corrected. Please use
the Moodle course for this.

## R exercises

In this directory, there are six R exercise sheets filed. The data
necessary for some of the exercises are provided in the Moodle course.
While coding is not poart of the final exam, this exercises aim to help
you understand and interpret statistical results better, which will be
part of the exam. The topics of the R-sheets are:

1.  Introduction in R
2.  Descriptive statistics in R
3.  Regressionmodels in R
4.  Visualisation of some statistical concepts in genetics
5.  Metaanalyses and Online-Tools
6.  Mendelian Randomisation

Code for all exercises can be sumbitted and will be corrected or
commented.

## Git exercises

For those interested in git, there is a git directory with a small git
introduction and an exercise.
