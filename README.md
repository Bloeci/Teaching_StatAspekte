Scripts and other stuff for my class in winter term 2021/2022

# Part 1: Classic exercises
In this directory, all classic exercises are given. Classic means, that the exercises can be solved by pen & paper, you do not need R. They are quite similar to the assigments in the final exam (also to be solved by pen & paper, without any additional material or tools). 

# Part 2: R exercises

Every other week, I add a short R exercise.
