# Teaching_WS2122

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Teaching_WS2122 is to collect and update all exercises for my class. 

This is not planned as R package, so no installation needed, just fork the repository and work within your own github/git/RStudio enviroment. 

## To do

* Test ob transfer geklappt hat
* Add all exercises
* Update exercises after students feedback (typos, understandability of the tasks, etc.)
* Add solutions?

# Part 1: Classic exercises
In this directory, all classic exercises are given. Classic means, that the exercises can be solved by pen & paper, you do not need R. They are quite similar to the assigments in the final exam (also to be solved by pen & paper, without any additional material or tools). 

# Part 2: R exercises

Every other week, I add a short R exercise.
